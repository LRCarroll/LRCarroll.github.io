## Research and Education 

### Doctor of Philosophy (March 2018 - Present) 
<a href="https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/schools-and-departments/phys-chem/">School of Physical and Chemical Sciences</a>, University of Canterbury

**Supervisor:** <a href="https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/contact-us/people/alison-downard.html">Prof. Alison Downard</a>

**Co-supervisor:** <a href="https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/engineering/contact-us/people/martin-allen.html">Prof. Martin Allen</a>

**Thesis:** *Covalently-Bound Organic Modification of Transparent Metal Oxides: Effects on the Chemical and Electronic Surface Properties*

**Abstract:** This thesis describes the chemical modification and characterisation of SnO<sub>2</sub> thin-films and nanostructures and of β-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Due to the native OH termination of the metal oxide surfaces, SnO<sub>2</sub> and β-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> exhibit surface band bending. Previous work in our research group has found that the OH coverage on metal oxide surfaces correlates with the amount of band bending at the surface. Bare SnO<sub>2</sub> and β-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> surfaces exhibit downwards and upwards band bending, respectively, and the electron density at the surfaces can be increased by the formation of terminal OH groups on exposure to the atmosphere. Increased electron density results in greater conductivity, while a decrease in electron density makes the surface insulating. The OH coverage of metal oxides is highly susceptible to environmental changes, which can alter the conductivity at the surface and is undesirable for some transparent semiconducting devices. One approach to reducing the influence of the environment on OH coverage and changes in band bending is to coat the surface. Modification of SnO<sub>2</sub> using covalently bound molecules has previously been investigated; however, no reports on the deliberate modification of β-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> could be found. There has been very little investigation on chemically altering metal oxide band bending and none at all on β-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. This work investigates the effects on band bending when aryldiazonium ions, aryliodonium ions, phosphonic acids, and Na<sub>2</sub>S are used to modify the (101) surface of SnO<sub>2</sub> thin-films, (001) surfaces of SnO<sub>2</sub> nanotubes, and the (–201) and (010) surfaces of β-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.
