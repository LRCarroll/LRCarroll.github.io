<p style='text-align: justify;'> I am currently in the process of completing my PhD in chemistry from the University of Canterbury, New Zealand. I am currently scheduled to defend my thesis at the end of April 2022. I have also completed a BSc(Hons) in chemistry sand a BSc majoring in chemistry and mathematics, also from the University of Canterbury. My graduate research focuses on the chemical modification of transparent semiconducting materials to alter their electronic properties for use in devices.</p>
