Kia Ora, my name is Liam Carroll

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of New South Wales, Australia, where I work on developing electrochemical aptamer-based sensors. I completed my PhD in chemistry from the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, where I focused on the chemical modification of transparent semiconducting materials for use in electronic devices.

In addition to my PhD, I hold a BSc(Hons) in chemistry and a BSc majoring in chemistry and mathematics, both from the University of Canterbury. My research interests include nanotechnology, electrochemistry, and bioanalytical chemistry.

On this website, you'll find updates on my current research, publications, and other projects. Please note that the views expressed here are my own and not those of any organisation I am affiliated with. I will update this page when time permits, so please check back periodically. If you have any interesting opportunities or collaborations, please feel free to contact me below.
