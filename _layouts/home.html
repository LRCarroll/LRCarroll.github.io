So I have decided to make a personal website, now what? It is uncommon for graduate students in materials science to make a their own website; however for me there are many reasons:

* Start blogging, as a way to maintain writing skills. I plan on posting a mix of science and personal content.
* Showcase my research
* Write up "how to" blogs so that people don't have to spend hours working out how to do the things I have done. This is also handy when I need to revisit something I did and cannot remember how to do it.
* Understand the *internet* better and learn how to deploy and maintain a website

I learnt how to program using [MATLAB](https://au.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)  which is a great tool for for routine scientific computing tasks. I'm a big fan of MATLAB as it is a great more straight forward way of quickly visualising your data. You also don't have to deal with 'CS stuff' like libraries, dependencies, *etc.*, but, other languages like 'Python' are certainly more prominent in the software engineer roles, so I have also expanded my range and started using this too. So this website will be partially an exercise in breaking out of my 'MATLAB' comfort zone.

## Making this website
I initially based this website on [Peter M. Attia's website](https://petermattia.com/) which I found intriguing and thought I could accomplish something similar. The website was created using Jekyll on Github and I may shift this in the future to something more permanent, but currently want to just get this started and to be a place to host my [CV](CV). Jekyll is a static site generator, which means it creates nice-looking, speedy websites from relatively simple text editor input. I have now shifted to using the [Moonwalk](https://github.com/abhinavs/moonwalk) theme.
