**Abstract:**
Beta gallium oxide (β-Ga2O3) is an ultrawide-bandgap semiconductor with one of the highest-known breakdown strengths (∼8 MV/cm) making it a strong candidate for high-efficiency power electronics, deep-ultraviolet photodetectors, and transparent electronic devices. Bare β-Ga2O3 surfaces exhibit a strong upward band bending and electron depletion that is reduced by the formation of a hydroxyl termination on exposure to the atmosphere, although this effect varies with exposure conditions and the processing history of different samples. This work investigates the covalent modification of (2̅01) and (010) β-Ga2O3 surfaces with organic layers, as a mechanism for more effectively controlling their surface band bending. We compare the different electronic effects of grafted layers formed by the electrochemical reduction of 4-nitrobenzenediazonium ions and the spontaneous grafting of octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA). Atomic force microscopy, synchrotron X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy confirmed the presence of few-nanometer layers of covalently attached nitrophenyl (NP) and ODPA molecules. Valence band XPS showed that NP modification produced upward band bending shifts of +0.51 and +0.53 eV on (2̅01) and (010) β-Ga2O3, respectively, with further increases of +0.35 and +0.20 eV after X-ray-induced reduction of the nitro substituent to amino-like moieties. In contrast, ODPA modification produced downward shifts in surface band bending of −0.36 and −0.07 eV on (2̅01) and (010) β-Ga2O3, respectively. Our study demonstrates that covalently bound NP and ODPA molecules can be used to significantly modify the electronic properties of β-Ga2O3 surfaces, a finding that should prove useful for electronic applications of this material.

Relationship between the Hydroxyl Termination and Band Bending at (-201) β-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> Surfaces. *Phys. Rev. B* **2020**, 102 (3), 35304. DOI: <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.102.035304">10.1103/PhysRevB.102.035304</a>

**Abstract:** Synchrotron X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to explore the relationship between the hydroxyl termination and band bending at the ($\bar{2}01$) surface of β−Ga2O3 bulk single crystals. All as-received (¯201) surfaces were terminated with OH groups, with H/OH binding to surface Os/Gas atoms. Removal of this native OH termination produced a large upward shift in band bending of up to 1.0 eV, consistent with strong electron depletion and a semiconductor to insulator-like transition in the near-surface region. Simple surface treatments were used to control the size and stability of the band bending of as-received (¯201) surfaces by modifying the nature of the OH termination. NaOH (H2SO4) treatment consistently produced upward (downward) shifts in band bending and a significant increase (decrease) in the thermal stability of the OH termination that was associated with an increase in the relative density of Gas−OH (Os−H) species. Annealing in wet O2 (at 600 °C) produced an extremely stable OH termination and the strongest downward shift in band bending. These effects, combined with the relatively slow dissociation of H2O on bare (¯201) surfaces, allowed the preparation of surfaces with significant variations in band bending that may prove useful in optimizing the properties of β−Ga2O3 metal-semiconductor contacts and heterojunctions. A comparison of two methods used to determine the absolute band bending at semiconductor surfaces confirmed that bare β−Ga2O3(¯201) surfaces are characterized by strong upward band bending (∼0.5 to 1.0 eV) and an electron depletion layer that can be completely removed by the hydroxylation of the surface.
