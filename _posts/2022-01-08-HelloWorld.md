Why am I making a personal website? It’s not very common for graduate students in materials science. A few reasons:

* Start blogging, as a way to maintain writing skills (with some countability). I plan on posting a mix of science and personal content
* Develop a larger community for electrochemistry and materials science online— I wish there were more resources when I started grad school
* Showcase some of my research
* Understand the Internet better (because it still blows my mind)
* Learn web technologies

In both chemical engineering and materials science, everyone uses MATLAB, which I think is exceptional for routine scientific computing tasks. I’m a big fan of MATLAB—it’s great for engineers, particularly students, who need to quickly analyze data and don’t want to deal with ‘CS stuff’ like libraries, dependencies, etc. But, of course, I recognize no serious software engineer would even think about using it. So this website will be partially an exercise in breaking out of my MATLAB comfort zone.

## Making this website

In the process, I read a lot about how to make and host a website. There are plenty of options: Wordpress with Dreamhost, Wordpress with AWS, Jekyll on Github, Jekyll on AWS, etc. (Wordpress is a very common platform for blogs and personal sites, but it’s somewhat slow and clunky. Jekyll is a newer ‘static site generator’, which means it creates nice-looking, speedy websites from relatively simple text editor input.) I decided to go with Jekyll on AWS S3, since it’s the most difficult (relatively speaking—it’s wasn’t actually “difficult”)—meaning I’d learn the most from it.

It took about a full day to get everything where I wanted it to be— overall pretty easy and kinda fun, but still longer than what I expected for such a standard procedure. In contrast, I was able to get a Wordpress site on AWS running in around 30 minutes. I definitely wouldn’t recommend this method to most people trying to create a website, but it worked well for my purposes—I became more familiar with the Terminal, Markdown, AWS S3, domain names, etc.
