So I have decided to make a personal website, now what? It is uncommon for graduate students in materials science to make a their own website; however for me there are many reasons:

* Start blogging, as a way to maintain writing skills. I plan on posting a mix of science and personal content.
* Showcase my research
* Write up "how to" blogs so that people don't have to spend hours working out how to do the things I have done. This is also handy when I need to revisit something I did and cannot remember how to do it.
* Understand the *internet* better and learn how to deploy and maintain a website

I learnt how to program using [`MATLAB`](https://au.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)  which is a great tool for for routine scientific computing tasks. I'm a big fan of `MATLAB` as it is a great more straight forward way of quickly visualising your data. You also don't have to deal with 'CS stuff' like libraries, dependencies, *etc.*, but, other languages like 'Python' are certainly more prominent in the software engineer roles, so I have also expanded my range and started using this too. So this website will be partially an exercise in breaking out of my 'MATLAB' comfort zone.

## Making this website

In the process, I read a lot about how to make and host a website. There are plenty of options: Wordpress with Dreamhost, Wordpress with AWS, Jekyll on Github, Jekyll on AWS, etc. (Wordpress is a very common platform for blogs and personal sites, but it’s somewhat slow and clunky. Jekyll is a newer ‘static site generator’, which means it creates nice-looking, speedy websites from relatively simple text editor input.) I decided to go with Jekyll on AWS S3, since it’s the most difficult (relatively speaking—it’s wasn’t actually “difficult”)—meaning I’d learn the most from it.

It took about a full day to get everything where I wanted it to be— overall pretty easy and kinda fun, but still longer than what I expected for such a standard procedure. In contrast, I was able to get a Wordpress site on AWS running in around 30 minutes. I definitely wouldn’t recommend this method to most people trying to create a website, but it worked well for my purposes—I became more familiar with the Terminal, Markdown, AWS S3, domain names, etc.
