I am currently based in the <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/science/our-schools/chemistry/our-research/our-research-groups/smart-materials-and-surfaces-group">Smart Materials and Surfaces Group</a> in the School of chemistry at the University of New South Wales, working with <a href="https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/scientia-professor-justin-gooding">Scientia Prof. Justin Gooding</a>. Our team is currently developing next generation electrochemical aptamer-based biosensors.

As a PhD student in the School of Physical and Chemical Sciences at the University of Canterbury, I worked with Prof. Alison Downard, Prof. Martin Allen, and Prof. Roger Reeves exploring the physical, chemical, and electronic properties and device applications of metal oxide semiconductors. My work aimed to combine fundamental, applied, and computational approaches to study the surface chemistry of ZnO, Ga<sub 2</sub> degradation.
